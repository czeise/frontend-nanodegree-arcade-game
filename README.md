# Classic Arcade Game

This classic arcade game, loosely based on [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), is part of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## Playing the Game!
Check out [the latest version of this game hosted here on GitHub Pages](https://czeise.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/).
- Move the player using the keyboard arrows
- Don't hit the enemy bugs!
- If you reach the water, you've won!

## Issue Status
I used Waffle to track my progress while working on this project.
